# Awesome Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization Resources
We would like to maintain a list of resources that utilize machine learning technologies to solve combinatorial optimization problems. 

We mark work contributed by [Thinklab](http://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn) with ✨.

*We are looking for post-docs interested in machine learning especially for learning combinatorial solvers, dynamic graphs, and reinforcement learning. Please send your up-to-date resume via yanjunchi AT sjtu.edu.cn.*
