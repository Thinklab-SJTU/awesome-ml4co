# Awesome Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization Resources
We would like to maintain a list of resources that utilize machine learning technologies to solve combinatorial optimization problems.

We mark work contributed by [Thinklab](http://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn) with ‚≠ê.

*Maintained by members in SJTU-Thinklab: Chang Liu, Runzhong Wang, Jiayi Zhang, Zelin Zhao, Haoyu Geng, Tianzhe Wang, Wenxuan Guo, Wenjie Wu, Nianzu Yang, Ziao Guo, Yang Li, Hao Xiong, Jiale Ma, Wenzheng Pan and Junchi Yan. We also thank [all contributers from the community](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/awesome-ml4co/graphs/contributors)!*

*We are looking for post-docs interested in machine learning especially for learning combinatorial solvers, dynamic graphs, and reinforcement learning. Please send your up-to-date resume via yanjunchi AT sjtu.edu.cn.*
